When I first looked at it I wasnt sure what to do with it. The more I thought about it I noticed there was 1 full blank and if you count the number of boxes in each grid its 25 (5 rows, 5 columns)
I immediately thought of the alphabet. I wasn't sure if the blank one was Z or A. Turns out to be A, and the first block of the grid is B.
